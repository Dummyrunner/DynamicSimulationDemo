title = "A convex optimization approach to cancer treatment to address tumor heterogeneity and imperfect drug penetration in physiological compartments",
abstract = "The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance. Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma.",

abstract = {We investigate adaptive strategies to robustly and optimally control the COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that (1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and (3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.}

abstract = {This paper derives new results in non-linear system analysis using methods inspired from fluid mechanics and differential geometry. Based on a differential analysis of convergence, these results may be viewed as generalizing the classical Krasovskii theorem, and, more loosely, linear eigenvalue analysis. A central feature is that convergence and limit behavior are in a sense treated separately, leading to significant conceptual simplifications. The approach is illustrated by controller and observer designs for simple physical examples.}
